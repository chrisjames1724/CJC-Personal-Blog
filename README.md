# CJC-Personal-Blog

## Description

This was a project in which we were instructed to create a blog from scracth using no starter code based off og the given criteria. We needed to have a blog "form" page in which the inputs of a username, blog title and blog contents were collected and stored in local storage. Once all the information was submitted it would redirect you to the blog page where the blogs would be autopopulated from the local storage. At the bottom of the page you were instructed to include a link to a prtfolio that was created in an eariler hw assignment. The blog page was to be equipped with a "back" button allowing the user to return to the "form" page in order to submit additional blogs. Additionally, each page had a light/dark mode feature turning the mode of the page dark or light based on the sun or moon emoji.

## Installation

Go to my github page @ https://github.com/chrisjames1724. You can go into the repositories section and check out the code, README and other files in there or use this link to see the deployed site: https://chrisjames1724.github.io/CJC-Personal-Blog/.

## Usage

Once the page is opened it will look like th image below:

In this page one is to submit a blog by providing inputs to the "username," "title," and "Contents" sections. As seen below:

If the user were to not fill out one of the input fields they would receive an alert telling the user to make sure there is content in each field like the one below:

Once a blog is submitted successfully they following alert witll appear to let you know it was a success:

Once you press "OK" after the successful submission you are redirected to the blog page which will populate the blog you had just submitted:

At the bottom of the page in the footer we were instructed to provide a link to our profile page from a former HW assignment. You can see the linked portfolio here:

Another feature we were instructed to include was the ability to go back to the original blog form submission page in order to post additional blogs. The bag button seen here below allows you to do just that.

And lastly, one more feature we were asked to provide was the ability to go from light to dark mode and back to light mode. That is accomplished by pressing the following buttons in the top right of the page
