# CJC-Personal-Blog

## Description

This was a project in which we were instructed to create a blog from scracth using no starter code based off og the given criteria. We needed to have a blog "form" page in which the inputs of a username, blog title and blog contents were collected and stored in local storage. Once all the information was submitted it would redirect you to the blog page where the blogs would be autopopulated from the local storage. At the bottom of the page you were instructed to include a link to a prtfolio that was created in an eariler hw assignment. The blog page was to be equipped with a "back" button allowing the user to return to the "form" page in order to submit additional blogs. Additionally, each page had a light/dark mode feature turning the mode of the page dark or light based on the sun or moon emoji.
